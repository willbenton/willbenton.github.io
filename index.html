 <p>People always talk about the ups and downs of life - about the roller coaster ride of uncertain happiness - that life is. In the past I shared this same belief; that when you head out the front door to start a new day you could be greeted by a nasty shit storm, or sunshines and rainbows. Just like Forest Gumps Mama taught him, "life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what your gonna get.", but is it though? Is life, happiness, success, all just up to chance? Personally I no longer think so. This is for one reason and one reason only, SAMANTHA PAIGE CANNATA. Ever sense Sammie became increasingly involved in my life I have had the great benefit of knowing what each day will bring. I get to wake up and know that come sunshine and rainbows, or nasty shit storm, I'll happily enjoy it because of sammie. Forest and his Mama can believe what they wanna believe, but my life is no box of chocolates.</p>
